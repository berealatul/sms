## Core Functionalities

1. **Role-Based Dashboards**

   - **Admin**:
     - Add/manage faculty and student accounts.
     - Mark faculty as **NON\_WORKING** and trigger automatic reassignment alerts.
     - Assign mentors, supervisors, and guides to each student.
     - Request submissions or additional requirements from users and track their status.
     - Final approval authority for all student data submissions.
   - **Faculty**:
     - View assigned students by role.
     - Request missing documents or clarifications from students.
     - Review submissions, comment, and request revisions.
     - Approve or reject data, forwarding approved entries to Admin.
     - Monitor student progress and provide ongoing feedback.
   - **Student**:
     - Upload and edit personal and academic details.
     - View assigned mentors, supervisors, guides, and Admin contacts.
     - Track submission statuses (Pending â†’ Received â†’ Approved/Rejected).
     - Read feedback and comments from Faculty and Admin.

2. **Multi-Stage Approval Workflow**

   - Student submits data â†’ Faculty review â†’ Admin final approval.
   - Comprehensive audit trail with timestamps and comments.

3. **Notifications & Tracking**

   - Real-time dashboard indicators for pending tasks and approvals.

4. **Data Management & Security**

   - MySQL-backed relational database for structured storage.
   - Djangoâ€™s built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities.
